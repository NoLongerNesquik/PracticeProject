# PracticeProject
github practice
Each team member should then Fork the PracticeProject created by your teammate.
Next use IntelliJ to clone YOUR remote fork of the project.
All team-members should use the IntelliJ Git tab at the bottom to create a new feature branch from their local clone of main.
    This will work better if everyone uses a different feature branch name, so give your feature branch a name like "featureTrevor," but substituting Trevor for your name.
Now create or edit a README.md file in your project with any intelligent quote you can find!
Next commit and push your README.md file change back to your remote origin.
    If you have created your feature branch correctly, it should push back to your remote origin as something like feature<YOURNAME>, so pay attention and make sure before pushing (Ask for help if it doesn't)
From your GitHub account, issue a Pull request back to the original team-member's PracticeProject repo.
    Even if GitHub warns that there are conflicts, create the Pull request.
Now, as a TEAM, huddle around the original project creator's screen, Update or Refresh their GitHub clone via the Git tab at the bottom of the IntelliJ. Have the person check out their local, or from the remote, main branch.
